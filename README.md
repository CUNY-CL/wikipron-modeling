[`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/download.html)
is recommended for a reproducible environment.
Once you have conda installed, create a new conda environment by running this:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

The new environment is called "task1". Activate it by running this:

```bash
conda activate task1
```
